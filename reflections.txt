You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. 
Answer the following questions:
  

* What new skills have you learned?
  
I have some experience with HTML, but I think even the easiest things have become so much more clear to me in this first section.
Learning about adding hyperlinks and images was something I needed to work on.

* What has been easy?
 
I think the first project was pretty easy, because a lot of what we had to do was taught in the lessons, and everything else we could easily look up. 

* What has been difficult?
  
I still struggle with understanding paths.

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?


I looked up a lot of the problems I came across in this project, which gave me the answers to everything I needed.
